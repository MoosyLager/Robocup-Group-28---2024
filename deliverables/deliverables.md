### Electrical/Software

- Detection function working then testing for ramp and obstacles.
- Navigation algorithm working: Including the IMU and testing for the IMU.
- Discussion for the colour sensor testing.
- Stepper motor for base lifting.
- Encoder motor implemented for the wheels and the collection mechanism.

### Mechanical

- Top sensors need to be on the side of caution, above 100mm.
- Recess the sensors into the bases.
- Interlocked wheels: Overlay, fully printed, connection mechanism.
- Mechanical design adjustment: adjust the range to be able to collect knocked over weights.
- Adjust the 3D printed materials for the stuff.
- Reverse sensor orientation sizes.
